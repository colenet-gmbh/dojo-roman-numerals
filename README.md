# Dojo Roman Numerals

This repository contains templates for the [roman numerals kata (kata-log.rocks)](https://kata-log.rocks/roman-numerals-kata) in different languages.

Before you start, please make sure
* your git username and email are setup correctly (verify by running `git config --list`)

* Preferably clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:colenet-gmbh/dojo-roman-numerals.git`

We will use [mob](https://mob.sh/) for timekeeping and code handover. Please install it and make sure that `mob moo` works

Each dojo will have its dedicated branch following the naming pattern `dojo-YYYY-MM-DD` and will be deleted after the dojo is over.

The actual kata-project can be found in the sub-directory for the corresponding language
